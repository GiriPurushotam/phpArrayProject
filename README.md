#simple array project using csv file

## description

This is a simple array project to demonstrate how to show data from a CSV file in a view-table using native PHP.

in this project, we have a file called `sample_1.csv`, and we extract the data from it inside the `view/transaction` folder. the transaction data is then displayed in a table inside the `transaction` file.
